Neo: representing electrophysiology data in Python
==================================================

.. module:: neo


Neo stands for Neural Ensemble Objects and is a project to provide common class names and concepts
for dealing with electrophysiological (real and/or simulated) data, with the aim of
providing a common basis for OpenElectrophy_, NeuroTools_, G-node_, Helmholtz_ and other projects with similar goals.

Neo provides in particular :
 - a set of classes with precise definitions
 - a IO module that offer a simple API that fit many formats.
 - documentation.
 - a set of examples, including a format convertor.

For Python users, Neo can be taken as a replacement for the Neuroshare_ API.

The people behind the project are very open to discussion. Any feedback is gladly received and highly appreciated!

`NiBabel`_ is a project with similar aims for Neuroimaging file formats.
