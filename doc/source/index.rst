Welcome to neo's documentation!
===============================

.. module:: neo

neo (Neural Ensemble Object) is a project to provide a common architecture for projects
in the field of analysing in vivo or simulated electrophysiological signals and/or action potential.
For moment, it is a base for unification between OpenElectrophy and NeuroTools (and maybe G-Node).
We hope that it could also a base for other projects.

neo provide in particular :
 - a set a classes with precise definiitions
 - a IO module that offer a simple API that fit many formats.
 - a documentation.
 - a set of examples like a format convertor.

So for python users, neo can taken as a remplacement of neuroshare API.
