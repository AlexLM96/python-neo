Welcome to neo's documentation!
===============================

.. module:: neo


NEO stands for Neural Ensemble Objects and is a project to provide common class names and concepts
for dealing with electrophysiological (real and/or simulated) data, with the aim of
providing a common basis for OpenElectrophy_, NeuroTools_, G-node_ and other projects with similar goals.

neo provides in particular :
 - a set of classes with precise definitions
 - a IO module that offer a simple API that fit many formats.
 - documentation.
 - a set of examples, including a format convertor.

For Python users, neo can be taken as a remplacement for the Neuroshare_ API.

The people behind the project are very open to discussion. Any feedback is gladly received and highly appreciated!
