Welcome to neo's documentation!
===============================

.. module:: neo


NEO stands for Neural Ensemble Objects and is a project to provide  common class names and concepts
for dealing with electro-physiological (in vivo and/or simulated) data with the aim of
getting OpenElectrophy, NeuroTools, G-node and maybe other projects with similar goals more close together.

neo provide in particular :
 - a set a classes with precise definitions
 - a IO module that offer a simple API that fit many formats.
 - a documentation.
 - a set of examples like a format convertor.

So for python users, neo can taken as a remplacement of neuroshare API.

People behind the project are very open to discussion. Any feedback is gladly welcome and highly appreciated!
