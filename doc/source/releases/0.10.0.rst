========================
Neo 0.10.0 release notes
========================

9th July 2021


Removal of Unit and ChannelIndex
--------------------------------
In version 0.9.0 :class:`Group` and :class:`ChannelView` replace :class:`Unit` and :class:`ChannelIndex`.
In this version the deprecated :class:`Unit` and :class:`ChannelIndex` are removed and only the new class:`Group` and :class:`ChannelView` objects are available.



Supported Python and NumPy versions
-----------------------------------

We no longer support Python 3.6, nor versions of NumPy older than 1.16.


Other new or modified features
------------------------------

See all `pull requests`_ included in this release and the `list of closed issues`_.
  * SpikeTrain can now also be provided as two arrays: one containing spike times
    and the other unit identities of the times (:class:`SpikeTrainList`)
  * Object identity is now preserved when using utility time_slice methods


New IO modules
--------------

  * CEDIO - an alternative to spike2io
  * AxonaIO
  * OpenEphysIO - handle the binary format
  * PhyIO
  * SpikeGLXIO
  * NWBIO
  * MaxwellIO

RawIO modules
-------------

Internal refactoring of the neo.rawio module about the channel grouping.
There is a signal_stream filed that handle channel groups for signal.
This enhanced the way annotation and array_annotaion are rendered at neo.io level.


Bug fixes and improvements in IO modules
----------------------------------------

  * The NeuralynxIO was refactored and now supports new file versions (neuraview) and single file loading.
  * Legacy versions of old IOs were removed for NeuralynxIO (neuralynxio_v1), BlackrockIO, NeoHdf5IO
  * NixIOfr now supports array annotations of :class:`AnalogSignal`s.
  * The IO modules of this release have been tested with version 0.1.0 of the
    `ephy_testing_data`_
  * NSDFIO was removed
  * all IOs now accept `pathlib.Path` objects
