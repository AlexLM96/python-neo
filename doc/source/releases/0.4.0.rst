DATE





Updating code from 0.3 to 0.4
=============================

To update your code from Neo 0.3 to 0.4, run through the following checklist:

    * Change all usages of :class:`AnalogSignalArray` to :class:`AnalogSignal`.
    * Change all usages of :class:`EpochArray` to :class:`Epoch`.
    * Change all usages of :class:`EventArray` to :class:`Event`.

.. note:: in each of these cases, the datastructure is still an array, it just has a shorter name.

    * If you are using :class:`RecordingChannel`\s
RecordingChannel/RCG --> ChannelIndex
